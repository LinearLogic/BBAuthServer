#BBAuthServer

BBAuthServer is the account verification server for the Blazing Barrels game.
When the BB client is launched, the user is prompted to log in with credentials
(username and password), which are passed to the BBAuthServer. If the provided
login info is correct, the user is added to a list of authenticated accounts.
When the user then attempts to connect to a multiplayer BBGameServer, the game
server sends a query to the BBAuthServer to ascertain whether the user is
authenticated. If so, the user is allowed to connect and play online.
